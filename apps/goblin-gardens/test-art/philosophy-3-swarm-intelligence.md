# Swarm Intelligence

**Algorithmic Philosophy for Goblin Gardens Splash Screen #3**

## Philosophy

Goblins do not fight alone—they swarm. A single goblin is weak, but thousands moving as one become an unstoppable tide. This philosophy celebrates emergent collective behavior, where individual agents following simple rules create complex, organic group patterns. Boids flocking algorithms meet goblin chaos: hundreds of small creatures scuttling across the canvas, clustering and separating, forming writhing masses that pulse with coordinated life.

The computational core implements a three-rule system perfected through decades of artificial life research: separation (avoid crowding neighbors), alignment (steer toward average heading of local flock), and cohesion (move toward average position of neighbors). Each goblin-agent scans its neighborhood, calculates steering forces, and adjusts velocity accordingly. From these local interactions, global patterns emerge—swarms splitting around obstacles, reforming on the other side, rivers of movement flowing like living liquid.

The algorithm layers additional goblin personality atop classical boids. Agents are drawn toward "loot points"—shimmering targets that appear and disappear, causing the swarm to surge in new directions. Some agents move faster, others lag behind, creating natural variation in the flow. Collision avoidance keeps individuals from overlapping while maintaining tight pack cohesion. The swarm never rests—it breathes, expands, contracts, always in motion.

Visual expression uses color to convey swarm density. Individual goblins are rendered as small shapes—circles or triangles—colored from green to yellow based on local crowding. Dense clusters glow brighter, sparse regions fade darker. Motion trails accumulate where the swarm has passed, leaving ghostly paths that fade slowly. The overall effect is mesmerizing—organic, alive, unpredictable yet coherent. You can almost hear the chittering.

This is computational craft at its finest—force coefficients balanced so the swarm neither explodes apart nor collapses into a single point, visual parameters tuned for maximum expressiveness without visual clutter, performance optimized to handle hundreds of agents smoothly. Every detail painstakingly refined until the goblin swarm feels viscerally real, the product of deep expertise in emergent systems.

## Conceptual Connection

This splash screen captures the goblin essence: weak individually but powerful in swarms. It represents the game's theme of goblins as chaotic, numerous creatures that move in coordinated masses—a visual metaphor for community gameplay and the overwhelming tide of goblin forces.
