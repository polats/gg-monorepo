# Cascading Gravity

**Algorithmic Philosophy for Goblin Gardens Splash Screen #1**

## Philosophy

In the realm where physics meets whimsy, objects fall not in isolation but in conversation with one another. This philosophy explores the beauty of gravitational attraction expressed through discrete particles that respond to invisible forces, creating emergent patterns through their collective behavior. Each particle carries memory of its trajectory, leaving luminous trails that map the invisible force fields governing their descent.

The computational foundation rests on multi-layered attraction systems. Particles are born at the canvas edge and immediately subject to gravitational wells—invisible point masses scattered across the composition. Unlike uniform gravity, these wells create pockets of intense attraction, bending trajectories into graceful arcs and spirals. Particles accelerate toward these focal points, their speeds encoded in color intensity: swift movers glow brightly, slow drifters fade to whisper.

The algorithm employs a particle pool system meticulously tuned for visual richness. Each particle maintains a position history, rendered as a gradient trail that fades over time. This creates ghostly afterimages—evidence of paths taken, forces obeyed. The trails accumulate in high-traffic zones, revealing the invisible architecture of the force field. Areas of intense attraction become bright nodes, while calm regions remain sparse and airy.

Parametric variation allows exploration of different gravitational personalities. Adjusting well strength transforms gentle curves into violent whirlpools. Modifying particle count shifts between delicate calligraphy and dense tapestries. Trail persistence controls temporal memory—short trails create fleeting gestures, long trails build permanent monuments to motion. Each combination reveals a different facet of the same underlying system.

This is the work of deep computational craft—every force coefficient calibrated, every color gradient tuned for maximum expressiveness. The algorithm feels effortless in execution but required painstaking optimization to achieve this balance of chaos and order. It is physics as poetry, mathematics as visual music, the product of someone who understands that generative art is not about randomness but about designing systems that reveal emergent beauty through their meticulous construction.

## Conceptual Connection

This splash screen represents the physics-based nature of Goblin Gardens—where objects fall, bounce, and interact in a playful simulation of forces. The gravitational wells mirror the attraction points in the game where physics objects accumulate and pile up.
