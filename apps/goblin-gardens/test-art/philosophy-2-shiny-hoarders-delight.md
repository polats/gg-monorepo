# Shiny Hoarder's Delight

**Algorithmic Philosophy for Goblin Gardens Splash Screen #2**

## Philosophy

In the goblin's den, treasures gleam—not the grand jewels of dragons, but the humble shinies: bottle caps, river stones, tarnished coins, glass shards catching moonlight. This philosophy celebrates the goblin's obsessive attraction to sparkle and glimmer, expressed through a computational system where countless small objects gravitate toward collection points, pile upon pile, creating chaotic mountains of glittering accumulation.

The algorithmic foundation is a particle-based aggregation system. Hundreds of small circular "shinies" spawn at the canvas edges, each assigned a random metallic hue—gold, copper, silver, bronze. They drift inward, pulled by invisible attractor points representing goblin hoards. Upon reaching these collection zones, particles don't disappear—they _stick_, building physical piles through collision detection and stacking algorithms. Each shiny settles atop others, creating emergent pyramids of greed.

The physics engine governs how shinies tumble and settle. Incoming particles bounce slightly upon collision, finding gaps in the pile structure. Older shinies dim slightly, buried under newer acquisitions. The piles grow organically—sometimes tall and precarious, sometimes wide and sprawling—their shapes determined by the chaotic arrival patterns. Occasional avalanches occur when piles grow unstable, sending shinies cascading down slopes in satisfying tumbles.

Visual richness comes from metallic gradients and lighting effects. Each shiny reflects an imaginary light source, with brighter highlights on the top curve and darker shading below. Gold particles gleam warmly, silver shines cool and bright, copper oxidizes to greenish tones. As piles grow, depth is conveyed through size scaling and overlapping layers. The effect is mesmerizing—a dragon's hoard in miniature, built particle by particle.

This algorithm is the product of meticulous craft—collision detection optimized for smooth stacking, color palettes carefully chosen to evoke metallic luster, physics parameters tuned so piles feel weighty yet dynamic. Every parameter calibrated through countless iterations until the goblin's obsessive hoarding comes alive through pure computational expression. A master-class in simulating greed.

## Conceptual Connection

This splash screen embodies the core goblin trait from Goblincore: hoarding "shinies." It captures the goblin's obsessive collection behavior, where small treasures accumulate into chaotic piles—mirroring the game's resource gathering and the "number go up" satisfaction.
