# Mycelium Network

**Algorithmic Philosophy for Goblin Gardens Splash Screen #4**

## Philosophy

Beneath the forest floor, invisible threads connect everything. Mycelium—the fungal network that goblins cherish—spreads through soil and rot, carrying messages, sharing resources, binding the ecosystem together. This philosophy celebrates organic growth through recursive branching, where simple rules create complex living networks. What begins as a single spore becomes a vast interconnected web, pulsing with life, reaching into every corner of the canvas.

The algorithmic foundation is L-system branching combined with growth simulation. A seed point spawns the first mycelial thread. That thread grows forward, occasionally splitting into two branches. Each branch follows the same rules: grow, split, grow, split. Parameters control branching angle, growth rate, and splitting probability. The result is fractal-organic—self-similar at multiple scales yet never perfectly symmetrical. Subtle randomness ensures each network feels alive rather than mechanically generated.

Growth happens in real-time, allowing viewers to watch the network emerge. Early frames show sparse threads reaching outward. Middle frames reveal the interconnected web forming. Late frames display a dense network covering the canvas. The algorithm includes collision detection—when growing tips encounter existing threads, they sometimes merge, creating closed loops and reinforcing existing pathways. This mimics real mycelium behavior where threads anastomose to strengthen the network.

Visual expression emphasizes goblincore aesthetics: mossy greens, earthy browns, bioluminescent glows. Older threads fade to brown, newly grown tips glow pale green-white. Branching points are marked with small nodes—fruiting bodies or connection hubs. Optional spore particles drift lazily across the canvas, settling to spawn new growth points. The background is dark soil or rotting wood texture, making the pale threads stand out dramatically.

This algorithm represents deep craft—branching angles calibrated to avoid awkward patterns, growth rates tuned so the network fills the space evenly, collision detection optimized to handle hundreds of intersecting threads without performance degradation. Every parameter refined through countless iterations until the mycelium feels genuinely alive, as if you're watching real fungus spread through a Petri dish. Master-level generative biology.

## Conceptual Connection

This splash screen embodies Goblincore's love of mushrooms, decay, and the hidden beauty of nature's "ugly" processes. The mycelial network represents the interconnected community aspect of the game—individual goblins connected in a larger ecosystem, just like players in a community game.
