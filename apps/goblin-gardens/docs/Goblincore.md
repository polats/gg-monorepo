Goblincore is an online aesthetic and subculture that celebrates nature, often focusing on elements typically deemed "ugly" or chaotic, like swamps, mud, frogs, and mushrooms. It embraces the hoarding of small objects, sometimes called "shinies," and features a "feral child" or creature-like aesthetic in fashion, which includes earthy colors, layered and comfortable clothing, and an appreciation for secondhand items.  

Core elements

- **Nature:** 

  Focuses on aspects of nature not traditionally considered beautiful, such as moss, frogs, toads, rats, snails, and fungi. It often celebrates "gnarly forests" and chaotic animals rather than just pretty, sunlit fields. 

- **Hoarding:** 

  A core part of the aesthetic is collecting and appreciating small, "treasure-like" items, which can include found objects like coins, interesting rocks, or other second-hand items. 

- **Fashion:** 

  Clothing is often comfortable and practical for exploring nature, with an emphasis on earthy tones like moss green, brown, and umber. Outfits may feature layered, oversized, or mismatched items, and are often thrifted or worn-out, as getting dirty is not a concern. 

- **DIY and craft:** 
  Many people create their own goblincore-inspired items, such as pendants or jewelry featuring pressed flowers, moss, or other natural elements. 

Who it appeals to

- The aesthetic provides a sense of community and acceptance, especially for those who may feel like outsiders, including neurodivergent and LGBTQ+ individuals. 

- It offers a way to embrace a more chaotic and "messy" side of life that can be a welcome alternative to more traditionally "pretty" aesthetics like cottagecore.
