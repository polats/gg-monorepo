### 🎮 Risk vs. Reward

**High Risk, High Reward:**

- Death Cap - deadly poison ingredient, extremely valuable
- Destroying Angel - same as above
- Fly Agaric - psychedelic effects, folklore value
- Cordyceps - expensive, difficult to grow

**Low Risk, Moderate Reward:**

- Turkey Tail - common, useful for multiple purposes
- Oyster - easy to grow, good food source
- Chanterelle - reliable, tasty, valuable

**No Risk, Low Reward:**

- Decorative mushrooms (Earthstar, Bird's Nest)
- Common bioluminescent (Bitter Oyster)

### 🎮 Goblincore Aesthetic Alignment

**Perfect Goblincore Mushrooms:**

- 🍄 **Fly Agaric** - iconic fairytale mushroom, red & white
- 🍄 **Ghost Fungus** - mysterious glowing fungi
- 🍄 **Morel** - forest treasure, "shinie" texture
- 🍄 **Turkey Tail** - rainbow colors, found on dead wood
- 🍄 **Bleeding Tooth** - dramatic, unusual, "dark beauty"
- 🍄 **Dead Man's Fingers** - creepy, earthy, gothic
- 🍄 **Indigo Milk Cap** - rare color, oozes "milk"
- 🍄 **Cordyceps** - parasitic (darker side of nature)

**Aligns with "Trash to Treasure":**

- Turkey Tail, Oyster (break down wood scraps)
- Shaggy Mane (grows in disturbed, "trashy" areas)
- Bird's Nest (grows in mulch/wood chips)
- Honey Mushroom (grows on "dead" wood)

**Bioluminescence (Dark Crystal Inspiration):**

- All glowing mushrooms perfect for underground goblin caves
- Creates magical atmosphere without electricity
- Attracts nocturnal creatures
- Natural "runes" and "spellbook" aesthetic with glowing patterns
